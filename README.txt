OvoiD.JS is a WebGL wrapper library which includes sound and interactive support 
with a whole environnement for  WebGL interactives applications developpment. 
For that, OvoiD.JS can be considered as a middleware. However OvoiD.JS also 
allows a more low-level (or mixed low and high-level) developpment by providing 
an onion architecture.

OvoiD.JS is thought from both programmer and 3D artist's point of view. The goal 
is to provide a set of top-level methods for instant access to easily and 
quickly create interactives contents, and keep the possibility to create an 
custom "high-level" layer for more fine tweaks.
