OvoiD.JS is a WebGL wrapper library which includes sound and interactive support 
with a whole environnement for WebGL interactives applications developpment. 
OvoiD.JS can be considered as a middleware but it also allows a more low-level 
(or mixed low and high-level) developpment by providing an onion architecture.

OvoiD.JS is thought from both programmer and 3D artist's point of view. The goal 
is to provide a set of top-level methods for instant access to easily and 
quickly create interactives contents, and keep the possibility to create an 
custom "high-level" layer for more fine tweaks.
