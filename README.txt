 OvoiD.JS - WebGL Wrapper Library
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OvoiD.JS is a WebGL wrapper library which includes sound and interactive support 
with a whole environnement for  WebGL interactives applications developpment. 
For that, OvoiD.JS can be considered as a middleware. However OvoiD.JS also 
allows a more low-level (or mixed low and high-level) developpment by providing 
an onion architecture.

OvoiD.JS is thought from both programmer and 3D artist's point of view. The 
3D artist creates 3D contents, and wants to easily use it without thinking 
about how the whole thing is working. The programmer wants to keep the 
freedom to create its own tricks and features.

The goal is to provide a set of top-level methods for instant access to 
easily and quickly create interactives contents, and keep the possibility 
to create an custom "high-level" layer for more fine tweaks. 

OvoiD.JS provides the following features (in bulk):
- WebGL rendering engine.
- Rudimentary physics engine (forces & collisions).
- Scenes, graphs and nodes architecture and managment.
- Interfaces for importing and exporting 3D contents (COLLADA/JSON).
- Interface for Input's (Keyboard/Mouse) managment and interaction binding.
- Interface for frame/canvas managment.
- Simple audio or 3D audio support through HTML5 or Web Audio API (Chrome)
- GLSL wrapper and managment for custom shaders.
- Interface for contents loading and wait screen.
- Classes and methods for 3D geometric algebra and low-level data access.

BUG REPPORTS & COMMENTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OvoiD.JS Library still in developpment, is not fully tested, the 
documentation may have some misstakes, and it obviously remains some 
unknown bugs. Please send comments and bugs repports at:
